## What I do
- **Engineering leadership (IC + team enablement):** Drive architectural clarity, reduce complexity, and unblock teams through standards, templates, and pragmatic decision-making.
- **Cloud-native delivery systems:** Containerized services, CI/CD automation, reliable releases, and security-by-default across multiple repos and environments.
- **DevSecOps & quality culture:** Testing strategy, code-quality gates, reproducible builds, and maintainable developer workflows that scale with the team.

---

## Current focus
- **Platform / developer productivity:** repo scaffolds, CI templates, semantic versioning + release automation, consistent lint/test/security gates.
- **Distributed systems & messaging:** clean interface boundaries, adapter patterns, and “swap the backend without rewriting the app” design.
- **Operational excellence:** observability, runtime resilience, traceability, and reliability under real constraints (networks, environments, data volume).

## Tooling I live in
**Python** (pytest, tox/uv, Ruff, Bandit) · **Docker/Kubernetes/Helm** · **Linux** · **CI/CD** (Bitbucket Pipelines/GitLab style workflows)  
**AWS** (container-first patterns) · Git workflows (protected main, PR hygiene, commit conventions, semantic-release)

## Highlights
- **Cloud-native modernization:** Moved legacy patterns to container-first delivery with repeatable pipelines and strong quality gates.
- **Standards & documentation:** Built onboarding/dev guides, Definition of Done, testing strategy, and workflow conventions to scale a growing team.
- **Messaging abstraction:** Designed a backend-agnostic messaging interface + adapters to reduce vendor lock-in and sustainment burden.

## Trajectory
I’m aiming toward **Engineering Manager / Developer Productivity / Platform Leadership** roles—where I can combine delivery ownership, technical direction, and team growth.
