## What I do
- Build **platform “paved roads”** (repo scaffolds, CI templates, release automation, policy guardrails)
- Deliver **cloud-native mission software** with container-first, maintainable architectures
- Improve **security & quality by default** (reproducible builds, dependency hygiene, traceable artifacts)

## Current focus
- **Internal Developer Platforms** (golden paths, one-command local dev, standardized pipelines)
- **Developer Productivity** (shared tooling, conventions, fast feedback loops)
- **Operational Excellence** (observability, resilience, commit → artifact → image traceability)

## Stack
**Python** (uv, pytest, tox, Ruff, Bandit)
**Docker · Kubernetes · Helm** · **Bitbucket Pipelines** · **AWS** · **Git**

## Selected work
- **NASA GSFC Flood Mapping System** — near-real-time satellite flood mapping for disaster response  
  *(Python, PHP/Laravel, MySQL, AWS ECS/S3)*

## Next
Targeting **Platform Engineering / Developer Productivity / Engineering Management** roles with ownership of **technical direction, delivery outcomes, and team growth**.
