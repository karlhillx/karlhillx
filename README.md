🚀 **Staff / Lead Aerospace Software Engineer** · **Platform/DevEx & DevSecOps** · **Scrum Master (PSM II, PSPO I)**  
I build **secure, cloud-native ground systems** for mission modeling & operations—and the **platform workflows** that keep teams shipping safely in constrained environments.

Focus: **internal developer platforms, supply-chain integrity, and always-green CI**.

## What I build
- **Platform/DevEx “paved roads”**: repo scaffolds, CI templates, policy-as-code, semantic versioning + release automation—so teams ship the same way across many repos.
- **Cloud-native mission software**: container-first services, reliable deployments, clean interfaces, and maintainable architecture for long-lived systems.
- **Security & quality by default**: reproducible builds, dependency hygiene, SBOM/provenance-minded pipelines, and fast feedback loops that scale.

---

## Now
- **Internal Developer Platform**: golden paths, “one command” local dev, standardized build/test/release, consistent PR gates.
- **Distributed systems & messaging**: backend-agnostic interfaces + adapters (swap brokers without rewriting apps).
- **Operational excellence**: observability, resilience, traceability (commit → artifact → image digest) under real constraints.

---

## Stack I ship with
**Python** (uv, pytest, tox, Ruff, Bandit) · **Linux** · **Docker/Kubernetes/Helm**  
**CI/CD** (Bitbucket Pipelines) · **AWS** (container-first patterns) · Git (protected main, PR hygiene, conventional commits/semantic-release)

---

## Highlights
- **Container-first modernization**: standardized builds + repeatable delivery workflows across multiple repos/environments.
- **Docs & standards that scale**: onboarding, Definition of Done, testing strategy, templates, and conventions that reduce team friction.
- **Messaging abstraction**: clean broker interface + adapters to reduce lock-in and sustainment burden.
